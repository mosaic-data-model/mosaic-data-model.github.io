        <p>Mosaic is a modular set of data models and file formats for molecular
simulation. The two main goals of the Mosaic project are</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Provide a way to store a very detailed description of a molecular
simulation for publication and archiving, according to the
principles of
[[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility%7CReproducible">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility|Reproducible</a> Research]].</p></li>
<li><p>Facilitate the exchange of data between molecular simulation
software packages.</p></li>
</ul><p>For an overview of what changes in molecular simulation Mosaic will
enable, see [[MolecularSimulationWithMosaic]]. For the criteria that
influenced design decisions in Mosaic, see [[DesignCriteria]]. For
example files and a PDF version of the documentation, see the
[[<a href="http://bitbucket.org/molsim/mosaic/downloads%7Cdownload">http://bitbucket.org/molsim/mosaic/downloads|download</a> page]].</p>

<p>=== Contributing to Mosaic development ===</p>

<p>If you would like to contribute to the development of Mosaic, please
join the mailing list at
[[<a href="https://groups.google.com/d/forum/mosaic-developers%5D">https://groups.google.com/d/forum/mosaic-developers]</a>].</p>

<p>=== Current status ===</p>

<p>While Mosaic should still be considered "under development", it has been used in real research projects and publications. Future developments of the specification are most likely to be extensions.</p>

<p>For an overview of development plans, see the [[Future]] page.</p>

<p>=== The Mosaic definition ===</p>

<p>Mosaic currently defines five kinds of data items:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A //universe// is the definition of the system topology (periodic
boundary conditions etc.) and the chemical structure of its
molecules (fragment hierarchy, bond network). The universe
definition is the central data structure in Mosaic, because it
permits the correct interpretation of the other data types.</p></li>
<li><p>A //configuration// provides a set of positions for all atoms plus
the geometric parameters of the simulation cell if periodic boundary
conditions are used.</p></li>
<li><p>A //property// stores one value for each atom in a universe. The
value can be an N-dimensional array of integers or floats. Property
items are very versatile. They can be used to store masses, charges,
velocities, forces, and much more.</p></li>
<li><p>A //label// stores a text string for each atom in a universe. Labels
are used for storing alternate atom names, atom types, and similar
information.</p></li>
<li><p>A //selection// stores a subset of the atoms or sites in a universe.
Selections are used for identifying parts of the system (e.g. solvent,
active site, ...).</p></li>
</ul><p>The Mosaic data model defines how these data items are expressed in
terms of basic data items (integers, floats, text strings) and basic
data structures (lists, arrays, trees, ...). The Mosaic file format
definitions describe how the data model is represented in files.
Conversion between different Mosaic file formats is exact; no
information is lost and no information needs to be deduced.</p>

<p>Currently there are two Mosaic file formats:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The [[<a href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/%7CHDF5%5D">http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/|HDF5]</a>] format provides compact
and efficient binary storage in a platform-independent way.
HDF5 is the right choice for large data sets (e.g. Molecular Dynamics
trajectories) and can be interfaced easily with programs written
in C, C++, or Fortran because of its array-based nature.</p></li>
<li><p>The [[<a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/%7CXML%5D">http://www.w3.org/XML/|XML]</a>] format provides text-based storage
that can be inspected and modified with any plain-text editor. A large
number of XML processing programs and XML libraries for all major
programming languages make it easy to do non-numerical processing
on molecular systems.</p></li>
</ul><p>Example files (converted from PDB structures) are available in the
[[<a href="http://bitbucket.org/molsim/mosaic/downloads%7Cdownload">http://bitbucket.org/molsim/mosaic/downloads|download</a> section]].</p>

<p>=== The Mosaic Python library ===</p>

<p>The current Mosaic Python library implements three
in-memory representations of the Mosaic data model and I/O in the two
supported file formats. It also contains an import module for
structures from the [[<a href="http://www.wwpdb.org/%7CProtein">http://www.wwpdb.org/|Protein</a> Data Bank]].  A
simple command-line tool can convert between the file formats and
write imported PDB structures to Mosaic files.</p>

<p>=== Related projects ===</p>

<ul>
<li>The <a href="RMF">[http://salilab.github.com/rmf/rmf.html|Rich Molecule Format]</a> shares some aspects of Mosaic, in particular the hierarchical
representation of molecules. However, the focus seems different
(molecular structures with annotations for visual representation
and experimental information), leading to different design choices.</li>
