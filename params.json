{"name":"MOSAIC - the MOlecular SimulAtion Interchange Conventions","tagline":"","body":"Mosaic is a modular set of data models and file formats for molecular\r\nsimulation. The two main goals of the Mosaic project are\r\n\r\n* Provide a way to store a very detailed description of a molecular\r\n  simulation for publication and archiving, according to the\r\n  principles of\r\n  [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility|Reproducible Research]].\r\n\r\n* Facilitate the exchange of data between molecular simulation\r\n  software packages.\r\n\r\nFor an overview of what changes in molecular simulation Mosaic will\r\nenable, see [[MolecularSimulationWithMosaic]]. For the criteria that\r\ninfluenced design decisions in Mosaic, see [[DesignCriteria]]. For\r\nexample files and a PDF version of the documentation, see the\r\n[[http://bitbucket.org/molsim/mosaic/downloads|download page]].\r\n\r\n=== Contributing to Mosaic development ===\r\n\r\nIf you would like to contribute to the development of Mosaic, please\r\njoin the mailing list at\r\n[[https://groups.google.com/d/forum/mosaic-developers]].\r\n\r\n=== Current status ===\r\n\r\nWhile Mosaic should still be considered \"under development\", it has been used in real research projects and publications. Future developments of the specification are most likely to be extensions.\r\n\r\nFor an overview of development plans, see the [[Future]] page.\r\n\r\n=== The Mosaic definition ===\r\n\r\nMosaic currently defines five kinds of data items:\r\n\r\n* A //universe// is the definition of the system topology (periodic\r\n  boundary conditions etc.) and the chemical structure of its\r\n  molecules (fragment hierarchy, bond network). The universe\r\n  definition is the central data structure in Mosaic, because it\r\n  permits the correct interpretation of the other data types.\r\n\r\n* A //configuration// provides a set of positions for all atoms plus\r\n  the geometric parameters of the simulation cell if periodic boundary\r\n  conditions are used.\r\n\r\n* A //property// stores one value for each atom in a universe. The\r\n  value can be an N-dimensional array of integers or floats. Property\r\n  items are very versatile. They can be used to store masses, charges,\r\n  velocities, forces, and much more.\r\n\r\n* A //label// stores a text string for each atom in a universe. Labels\r\n  are used for storing alternate atom names, atom types, and similar\r\n  information.\r\n\r\n* A //selection// stores a subset of the atoms or sites in a universe.\r\n  Selections are used for identifying parts of the system (e.g. solvent,\r\n  active site, ...).\r\n\r\nThe Mosaic data model defines how these data items are expressed in\r\nterms of basic data items (integers, floats, text strings) and basic\r\ndata structures (lists, arrays, trees, ...). The Mosaic file format\r\ndefinitions describe how the data model is represented in files.\r\nConversion between different Mosaic file formats is exact; no\r\ninformation is lost and no information needs to be deduced.\r\n\r\nCurrently there are two Mosaic file formats:\r\n\r\n* The [[http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/|HDF5]] format provides compact\r\n  and efficient binary storage in a platform-independent way.\r\n  HDF5 is the right choice for large data sets (e.g. Molecular Dynamics\r\n  trajectories) and can be interfaced easily with programs written\r\n  in C, C++, or Fortran because of its array-based nature.\r\n\r\n* The [[http://www.w3.org/XML/|XML]] format provides text-based storage\r\n  that can be inspected and modified with any plain-text editor. A large\r\n  number of XML processing programs and XML libraries for all major\r\n  programming languages make it easy to do non-numerical processing\r\n  on molecular systems.\r\n\r\nExample files (converted from PDB structures) are available in the\r\n[[http://bitbucket.org/molsim/mosaic/downloads|download section]].\r\n\r\n=== The Mosaic Python library ===\r\n\r\nThe current Mosaic Python library implements three\r\nin-memory representations of the Mosaic data model and I/O in the two\r\nsupported file formats. It also contains an import module for\r\nstructures from the [[http://www.wwpdb.org/|Protein Data Bank]].  A\r\nsimple command-line tool can convert between the file formats and\r\nwrite imported PDB structures to Mosaic files.\r\n\r\n=== Related projects ===\r\n\r\n* The [[http://salilab.github.com/rmf/rmf.html|Rich Molecule Format]]\r\n  (RMF) shares some aspects of Mosaic, in particular the hierarchical\r\n  representation of molecules. However, the focus seems different\r\n  (molecular structures with annotations for visual representation\r\n  and experimental information), leading to different design choices.\r\n\r\n=== Acknowledgements ===\r\n\r\nMosaic development was supported by the\r\n[[http://www.agence-nationale-recherche.fr/|Agence Nationale de la Recherche]]\r\nunder\r\n[[http://dirac.cnrs-orleans.fr/sputnik/home/|contract NÂ° ANR-2010-COSI-001-01]].\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
